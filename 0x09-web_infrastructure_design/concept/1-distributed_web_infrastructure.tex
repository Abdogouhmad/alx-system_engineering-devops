    \textbf{\underline{ Definitions and Explanations}}
    \subsection*{For every additional element, why you are adding it}
    \subsection*{What distribution algorithm your load balancer is configured with and how it works}
    \subsection*{Is your load-balancer enabling an Active-Active or Active-Passive setup, explain the difference between both}
    \subsection*{How a database Primary-Replica (Master-Slave) cluster works}
    \subsection*{What is the difference between the Primary node and the Replica node in regard to the application}
\section*{Issues: }
    \subsection*{SPOF}
        There are multiple SPOF (Single Point Of Failure).
        For example, if the Primary MySQL database server is down, 
        the entire site would be unable to make changes to the site (including adding or removing users).
        The server containing the load balancer and the application server connecting to the primary database server are also SPOFs.
    \subsection*{Security issues (no firewall, no HTTPS)}
        The data transmitted over the network isn't encrypted using an SSL certificate so hackers 
        can spy on the network. There is no way of blocking unauthorized IPs since there's no 
        firewall installed on any server.
    \subsection*{No monitoring}
        We have no way of knowing the status of
        each server since they're not being monitored.
