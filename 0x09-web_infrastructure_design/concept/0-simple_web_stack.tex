    \textbf{\underline{ Definitions and Explanations}}
    \subsection*{What is a server:}
        A server is a computer or system that provides resources, data, services,
        or programs to other computers, known as \textbf{clients}, over a network. In theory, 
        whenever computers share resources with client machines they are considered servers.
    \subsection*{What is the role of the domain name:}
        A domain name is user-friendly label that translates to numerical \textbf{IP}
        enabling easy access to websites and online resources. it acts as bridge
        between readable name and \textbf{IP addresses}.
    \subsection*{What type of DNS record \textcolor{red}{\texttt{www}}  is in 
                                \textcolor{red}{\texttt{ www.foobar.com}} :}
        \textbf{it is a cname}
    \subsection*{What is the role of the web server: }
        The role is to store, process and display website content(\textbf{CodeBase}).
        In addition, its role is to deliver web pages to users 
        (\underline{HTML} and \underline{CSS})over the protocol
        \underline{HTTP}.
    \subsection*{What is the role of the application server: }
        The role is to generate dynamic contents by executing server-side
        code such as \underline{JSP, PHP} etc...
    \subsection*{What is the role of the database: }
        The role is to manage the data systematically and efficiently In
        well-organized manner which allows data to be easily \textbf{accessed, readable 
        updated and deleted}.
    \subsection*{What is the server using to communicate with
                    the computer of the user requesting the website: }
        The server communicates through \textbf{\underline{HTTP}} protocol.

\section{Issues}
    \section*{SPOF (Single Point Of Failure)}
        There are a lot of single points of failures starting from
        having one server that contains only one web server. app server
        and database. A \textbf{Single point of failure} is part of system which fails
        when the entire system stop from working
    \section*{Downtime when maintenance
                needed (like deploying new code web server needs to be restarted)}
    \section*{Cannot scale if too much incoming traffic}
